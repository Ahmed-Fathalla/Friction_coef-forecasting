## Abstract
The thermal issues generated from friction are the key obstacle in the high-performance machining of titanium alloys. 2e friction
between the workpiece being cut and the cutting tool is the dominant parameter that a5ects the heat generation during the machining
processes, i.e., the temperature inside the cutting zone and the consumed cutting energy. Besides, the complexity is associated with the
nature of the friction phenomenon. However, there are limited e5orts to forecast the friction coe7cient during the machining
operations. In this work, the friction coe7cients between the titanium alloy against zirconia ceramics lubricated by minimum quantity
lubrication were recorded and measured using a universal mechanical tester pin-on-disc tribometer. 2en, we proposed two models
for forecasting the friction coe7cient which are trained and tested on the recorded data. 2e two predictive models are based on
autoregressive integrated moving average and gated recurrent unit deep neural network methods. 2e proposed models are evaluated
through a set of exhaustive experiments. 2ese experiments demonstrated that the proposed models can e7ciently be used to reduce
power consumption dedicated to monitoring the friction coe7cients. Besides, they can reduce or avoid surface thermal damage by
predicting the high level of friction coe7cients in advance, which can be used as an alert to enable or readjust the lubrication
parameters (<uid pressure, <uid <ow rate, etc.) to maintain lower ranges of friction coe7cients and power consumption.
