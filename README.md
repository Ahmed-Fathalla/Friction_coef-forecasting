## Abstract
The thermal issues generated from friction are the key obstacle in the high-performance machining of titanium alloys. The friction 
between the workpiece being cut and the cutting tool is the dominant parameter that affects the heat generation during the machining 
processes, i.e., the temperature inside the cutting zone and the consumed cutting energy. Besides, the complexity is associated with 
the nature of the friction phenomenon. However, there are limited efforts to forecast the friction coefficient during the machining 
operations. In this work, the friction coefficients between the titanium alloy against zirconia ceramics lubricated by minimum quantity 
lubrication were recorded and measured using a universal mechanical tester pin on a disc tribometer. Then, we proposed two models 
for forecasting the friction coefficient which are trained and tested on the recorded data. The two predictive models are based on 
auto-regressive integrated moving average and Gated Recurrent Unit Deep Neural Network methods. The proposed models are evaluated 
through a set of exhaustive experiments. These experiments demonstrated that the proposed models can efficiently be used to reduce 
power consumption dedicated to monitoring the friction coefficients. Besides, they can reduce or avoid surface thermal damage by 
predicting the high level of friction coefficients in advance, which can be used as an alert to enable or re-adjusting the lubrication 
parameters (fluid pressure, fluid flow rate, etc.) to maintain lower ranges of friction coefficients and power consumption.
